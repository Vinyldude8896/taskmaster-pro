# TaskMaster Pro

### User Story

As a User, I would like a task manager app that I can use any day of the week.. When I load this app I should see a sidebar with teh option to add a task or delete a task. In the main section of the screen I should see all of my tasks, and I should see wether they are in TO DO, In Progress, In Review or Done states. I want to be able to drag these tasks to whatever column they should be in. When I add a task, I should see a new window appear to Add a task, this should ask me for a Task Description and will also allow me to pick a date using a calendar. If I delete a task it should be removed from my columns.
